# Deep-Learning-for-American-Sign-Language-Detection-ASL-
This repository detects American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using deep learning models in PyTorch, including CNN, VGG16, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and DinoV2. It performs a comparative study and uses SVM with DinoV2. The project also features a web application built with TensorFlow and Gradio for interactive ASL recognition.
